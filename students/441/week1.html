<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Week 1:  Git doesn't Git</B></FONT></P>
<P>After Neil's lecture, I was inspired.  Looked at some of the tools
to use.  Thought I would try to use GitBook to build my personal
webpage.  Not understanding the application, and not understanding
the documentation, I proceeded to experiment with the application.  I
not only did not succeed in getting my webpage built, but I somehow
managed to crap up the entire LCCC section of the Fab-academy
archive.  At that point, I asked for help from my instructors.</P>
<P>The instructors managed to clean up a lot of the mess I made, but
in the process of cleaning up the mess, their Gitlab application
locked up in the process.  At that point everyone was stumped, and I
was on my own to solve it.  I tried GitLab.  I tried GitHub.  I tried
Bash.  I installed Ubuntu on a laptop several times, all with
unpredictable results.  I finally gve it  break since my wife started
having a gallbladder attach and required surgery  Emergency room –
what better place to do homework.</P>
<P>I continued to slug on with week 2 assignment, and re-inquired
with the instructor team at LCCC.  They were still stumped as was I. 
I decided to try to be productive with the staff and got help with
the vinyl cuter and the laser cutter.  I discussed my “initial”
final project with them, and they were helpful in providing me some
insight as to what Neil may want to see.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Index.lock</B></FONT></P>
<P>Back home I go to help my wife who is recovering nicely.  I decide
to do a little more research on the Git that won't Git.  I remember
taking a course on distributed computing from Steve Garland while at
Dartmouth, where he taught me the premise that every distributed
system works on a public key and a locking strategy.  I dug around a
little further and discovered there is a file called index.lock which
locks your directory while it is present.  This prevents anything
from working in your repository.  I used GitLab to delete the file,
and everything seemed good in Hinckley, Ohio the rest of that
evening.  I completed my index.html file and my aboutme.html file
with OpenOffice, an open source office suite which is free to
download, allows you to save as a HTML file, and does a half decent
job with pictures.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Final Project(s) – The FDC and the Wine Tank
Headspace Manager</B></FONT></P>
<P>One final project I would like to do is a device that can monitor
the headspace of a wine tank and control the addition of purge gas
(compressed Nitrogen, food grade).  Another final project I would
like to try is a rugged chassis for embedded computers such as a
Raspberry Pi.  I will call this a Field Deployable Computer, or FDC. 
Specifications would be weathertight, possibly mount as a riser box
to an existing PVC eletrical pull box.  It will have metal knobby
terminals so you can attach wires from a lead acid battery or other
low voltage source.  It will have an IEEE 802.15.4 Xbee radio and
communicate to a gateway box.  The waterproof cover will hold the
application specific sensor, input or output device, such as camera,
moisture sensor, gas sensor, thermocouple junction, etc... The
chassis should allow for two dry contacts.  The FDC may be able to be
configured for Wine Tank Headspace Manager.</P>
