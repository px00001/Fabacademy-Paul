                        Until this week, I have only done a little CAD, but it is clearly a very powerful tool to get ideas from the mind to reality. 
                        Starting on Thursday I began to do some 3D design in Autodesk Inventor. 
                        Inventor is 3D CAD software that I am most familiar with, but that is not saying much. 
                        Also, Inventor is what was previously installed on the laptop that I am using from my school district. 
                        I developed two designs over the next two days. Simple enough parts, but with increasing complexity. 
                        I know that I need to get better at CAD, so I spent some time trying to work with curved and rounded faces to advance my own skill. 
                        This meant that I spent quite a large amount of time trying iterative versions of the ‘queue’ and ‘hopper tray’ parts in Inventor. 
                        I quickly learned that working with rounded objects is much more challenging than purely linear and angular parts. 
                        I had to figure out how to place work faces and deal with extruding as a sweep along another drawing. 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                        For the sake of trying new software, I downloaded the Solidworks installation file, with an intent to install and try the software.
                        However, I never received an email with a product key. 
                        The terms on the Solidworks website seemed to read that I would have a 60-day trial without the authorization code, so I opted to pass on the installation until a later time.
                        Perhaps the installation code would come in and I could have a more permanent version of Solidworks.
                        In the meantime, I do not want a trial license running out midway through Fab Academy, and be forced to change software as a result. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                        In response to the delay from Solidworks, I turned to the next software built by the same person: Onshape.
                        Onshape is CAD software, which is entirely web-based. This utterly amazes me. 
                        I am astounded that this level of sophistication is even possible through a browser. 
                        I worked through the mechanics of developing a part and assembly in Onshape, and found it to be at least as easy to use as Autodesk Inventor.
                        I actually enjoyed the particular selection of controls within Onshape better than Inventor’s equivalent controls. 
                        Once I had made a part, I experimented with making a technical drawing for the first time. 
                        After a quick tutorial from the Onshape examples, I was able to make a fully detailed set of projection drawings, with dimensions. 
                        Next was a simple assembly in Onshape. For this, I quickly made a second part. A tray to fit into the base. 
                        This part is not overly complex, but I was able to experiment with an assembly of pieces, and giving those parts a simple constrained ‘slider’ relationship. 
                        Assigning a slider relationship was a simple point and click. Constraining the slider took a little more work: I had to determine how the motion was quantified and how it was offset.
                        Once I figured out the relationships of this motion, I was able to go back and edit my tray to be a little taller.
                        Conveniently, making a change to a model, such as this, is immediately reflected within the assembly.
                        My understanding all of these pieces of CAD seemed to be starting to fit together. I made a quick screencast of working with this assembly, visible below:

                        On Monday, I reviewed the assignment objectives for the week. It appeared that I had met many of them.
                        Now I needed to work within the 2D world. Developing raster and vector images is a part of this week’s goals, but it turned out I had done it the week before.
                        When developing my website, I came across the idea of a ‘favicon.’ I have always enjoyed the little logos on browser tabs. 
                        Perhaps unreasonably so. Those small identifiers that can add or detract personality and professionalism from a website simply keep me entranced. 
                        I appreciate a clear logo, with smooth edges and transparency to feel like a natural part of the browser. I knew I wanted to make a favicon of my own. 
                        First I developed on with MS paint. The classic among raster editors. I developed a blue swirl shape, with a black ‘C’ overlaid, all on a white background. 
                        I wanted it to be clear, but struggled to make it happen in Paint. 
                        I dealt with the product and integrated it into an early version of my website to see that I could do this. 
                        Discontent with this favicon, I downloaded Inkscape. I had used this software many years ago, perhaps back when I was in college at BGSU. 
                        Through this software I was able to develop the favicon that is on my website now. 
                        Using vectors, I was able to develop a much cleaner looking logo, include transparency, and make it much more scalable.
                        I had done some 2D CAD work before I even got to this week’s assignment.

                        Another one of the learning targets for this week is rendering. 
                        Up until Monday, I had not rendered a thing within any of the CAD software I had used. 
                        Long ago, again while I was at BGSU, I had used Blender to make some very simple cad renderings. 
                        Essentially a few spheres and cylinders, for bizarre math classes. :: haunting memories :: my recollections of Blender were simply that it was awkward to use. 
                        I am sure that it is great for design and animation, but that is not what I envision using CAD for personally. 
                        I downloaded and installed Blender, just to make a current assessment. Its interface still baffles me; even these many years later.
                        So I returned to Inventor. I had made a few unconnected parts in Inventor at the end of last week. 
                        These would be the start of my rendering work. One of the existing models became the springboard, and several corresponding parts were generated.
                        I wanted to build out a hopper assembly, and render at least an image and a video of that work. 
                        After watching a few tutorials on how to work with assemblies in Inventor, I was up and running. 
                        I have to say, Onshape was more straightforward for building assemblies -perhaps Onshape owes this to its ties with Solidworks. 
                        However, Onshape does not seem to have a native rendering capability. This seems reasonable, given that it is a browser-based software. 
                        Browsers can do a lot, but not everything. I stumbled upon the image rendering settings within Inventor. 
                        Although a static image was complete, it was clear I needed guidance for developing a video rendering. I turned to YouTube. 
                        <a href='https://youtu.be/SX7Zq_qHg08'>This</a> video guide walked me through the process of building a video rendering within Inventor.
                        Once the basic parameters of setting up a camera and selecting keyframes was completed, the reminder was quite straightforward. 
                        I would have liked to have a few of my parts fade out of the assembly, but the interface between my version of Inventor and the tutorial did not appear quite the same, and I needed sleep. 
                        I will develop my skill at making fancier renderings in the future. While I finish writing this section of my reflection, Inventor is rendering a 7.5-second video in the background. 
                        It has been over an hour, and it only appears to be 85% done. It is now clear to me that this is why I have such limited experience with renderings. 
                        They take such a very long time, and I often do not have a powerful enough computer at my disposal to make them more expeditious or a burning need for them.
